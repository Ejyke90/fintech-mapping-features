## 🎓 Best Practices

### Do's ✅

1. **Start Small**: Begin with 5-7 core metrics, expand over time
2. **Automate First**: Prioritize automated data collection over surveys
3. **Balance Quantitative & Qualitative**: Use both metrics and feedback
4. **Protect Privacy**: Anonymize individual data, focus on teams
5. **Share Insights**: Make data visible and actionable
6. **Iterate Often**: Review and adjust metrics quarterly
7. **Connect to Outcomes**: Always link metrics to business impact
8. **Celebrate Wins**: Highlight positive trends and successes

### Don'ts ❌

1. **Don't Overload**: Avoid tracking too many metrics initially

3. **Don't Ignore Context**: Consider team differences and constraints
4. **Don't Set Arbitrary Targets**: Base goals on benchmarks and capacity
5. **Don't Forget Qualitative**: Numbers don't tell the whole story
6. **Don't Compare Individuals**: Focus on team and org-level trends
7. **Don't Measure Everything**: Focus on actionable, meaningful metrics
8. **Don't Neglect Communication**: Explain why you're measuring
